## Built with
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites 

### Installation
Clone the repo and navigate to it. Run ```npm install``` to install all the required packages.

## Running locally

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Deployment

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
